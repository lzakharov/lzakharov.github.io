Hello Everyone!

<!--more-->

My name is Lev, and I'm a software engineer. I'm passionate about writing code,
and I believe that software engineering is a powerful tool to improve people's
lives.

This blog is a space to share thoughts and links about software engineering that
I find interesting. The website also provides information about me, such as
contacts and resume.
